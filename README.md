Quick SQLite uses [JSI](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/jsi-jsc-part-2), removes all the overhead of intercommunication between JavaScript code and C++ code, making CRUDing entities from SQLite super fast!

Big ❤️ to [react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) and [react-native-sqlite2](https://github.com/craftzdog/react-native-sqlite-2), this library also provides a WebSQL interface.

If you are using quick-sqlite in your app, please get in touch or open a PR with a modified README (with your company/product logo, would love to showcase you!

## GOTCHAS

- **It's not possible to use the browser debugger with JSI**, use [Flipper](https://github.com/facebook/flipper), on android Flipper also has an integrated database explorer you can use to debug your sqlite database, [you will have to configure your database path though](https://fbflipper.com/docs/setup/plugins/databases/).
  ![130516553-15c18d0f-65ad-44cf-8235-a4d6f41859e2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1634213/130755919-7539d3dd-7d30-4234-9965-bfef2450ab0a.png)
- Your app will now include C++, you will need to install the NDK on your machine for android. (unless you know how to generate an AAR, feel free to open a PR)
- If you want to run the example project on android, you will have to change the paths on the android/CMakeLists.txt file, they are already there, just uncomment them.
- This library supports SQLite BLOBs which are mapped to JS ArrayBuffers, check out the sample project on how to use it
- Starting with version 2.0.0 the library no longer throws errors when an invalid statement is passed, but rather returns an object with a `status` enum property, where 0 signals a succesful execution and `1` an incorrect execution (this is to keep typeorm from exploding when an incorrect query is executed)

## Use TypeORM

The recommended way to use this package is to use [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) with [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package). TypeORM already has a sqlite-storage driver. In the `example` project on the `patch` folder you can a find a [patch for TypeORM](https://github.com/ospfranco/react-native-quick-sqlite/blob/main/example/patches/typeorm%2B0.2.31.patch), it basically just replaces all the `react-native-sqlite-storage` strings in TypeORM with `react-native-quick-sqlite`.

Follow the instructions to make TypeORM work with rn (enable decorators, configure babel, etc), then apply the patch via patch-package and you should be good to go.

## Low level API

It is also possible to directly execute SQL against the db:

```typescript
interface ISQLite {
  open: (dbName: string, location?: string) => any;
  close: (dbName: string, location?: string) => any;
  executeSql: (
    dbName: string,
    query: string,
    params: any[] | undefined
  ) => {
    status: 0 | 1; // 0 for correct execution
    message: string; // if status === 1, here you will find error description
    rows: any[];
    insertId?: number;
  };
}
```

In your code

```typescript
// If you want to register the (globalThis) types for the low level API do an empty import
import 'react-native-quick-sqlite';

// `sqlite` is a globally registered object, so you can directly call it from anywhere in your javascript
// The methods `throw` when an execution error happens, so try/catch them
try {
  sqlite.open('myDatabase', 'databases');
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e); // [react-native-quick-sqlite]: Could not open database file: ERR XXX
}
```
